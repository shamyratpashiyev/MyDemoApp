# Streaming Fix Summary

## Problem
The SignalR streaming was working, but each chunk was being displayed as a separate message instead of concatenating to build up a single message.

## Root Cause
In the `ChatComponent.sendMessage()` method, the code was adding a new message to the `messages` array every time the observable emitted (on each chunk):

```typescript
// WRONG - This ran for every chunk
this.geminiService.sendMessage(userMessage).subscribe({
  next: (response) => {
    this.messages.push({  // ❌ Added new message for each chunk
      content: formattedResponse,
      isUser: false,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
  }
});
```

## Solution
Modified the component to:
1. **Create a placeholder message** once when streaming starts
2. **Update the existing message** content as chunks arrive
3. **Add visual streaming indicators** to show real-time progress

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. **Fixed Message Handling**
```typescript
// Create placeholder message once
const aiMessageIndex = this.messages.length;
this.messages.push({
  content: '',
  isUser: false,
  timestamp: new Date()
});

// Update existing message content
this.geminiService.sendMessage(userMessage).subscribe({
  next: (response) => {
    // ✅ Update existing message instead of adding new ones
    this.messages[aiMessageIndex].content = formattedResponse;
  }
});
```

#### 2. **Added Streaming State Management**
- Added `isStreaming: boolean` property
- Set to `true` when streaming starts
- Set to `false` when streaming completes

#### 3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**
- **Streaming indicator**: Shows "AI is thinking..." when content is empty
- **Progress indicator**: Shows "Streaming..." when content is being built
- **Animated dots**: Visual pulse animation during streaming

#### 4. **Fixed HTML Rendering**
- Changed from `[textContent]` to `[innerHTML]` to render `<br>` tags
- Added streaming indicators that only show for the last message during streaming

#### 5. **Improved Audio Playback**
- Audio only plays when streaming is complete
- HTML tags are stripped from text before sending to TTS

## Result
Now when you send a message:
1. **User message** appears immediately
2. **Empty AI message** appears with "AI is thinking..." indicator
3. **AI message content** builds up in real-time as chunks arrive
4. **Streaming indicator** shows "Streaming..." while content is being added
5. **Indicators disappear** when streaming completes
6. **Audio plays** the complete response (if enabled)

## Visual Flow
```
User: "Hello"
AI: [●●● AI is thinking...]
AI: "Hello! How" [●●● Streaming...]
AI: "Hello! How can I" [●●● Streaming...]
AI: "Hello! How can I help you today?" [Complete]
```

## Files Modified
1. **`chat.component.ts`**: Fixed message handling and added streaming state
2. **`chat.component.html`**: Added streaming indicators and fixed HTML rendering
3. **`chat.component.scss`**: Added streaming indicator styles with animations

The streaming now works as expected - building up a single message in real-time rather than creating multiple separate messages.
